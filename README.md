# ☕ Java Lab Exercises — Data Types, Variables & Arrays

### 📘 Overview

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly **Java Lab Exercises** focused on **data types, variables, operators, type casting, and arrays (1D & 2D)**.
Each lab introduces a new core concept of Java programming, helping learners strengthen their fundamentals through hands-on coding practice.

## 🧩 Lab Exercises

### 🔹 **Lab 1: Exploring Java Data Types**

**Objective:** Understand and use different Java primitive data types.
**Problem:**
Write a Java program that declares and initializes variables of all primitive data types —
`byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `char`, and `boolean`.
Display their values and their **memory size (in bytes)**.

📚 *Concepts Covered:* Primitive types, variable initialization, `System.out.println()`

---

### 🔹 **Lab 2: Variable Declaration and Arithmetic Operations**

**Objective:** Learn how to declare variables, assign values, and perform arithmetic.
**Problem:**
Declare three integer variables, assign values, and calculate their **sum**, **average**, and **product**.

📚 *Concepts Covered:* Arithmetic operators, integer division, variable assignment

---

### 🔹 **Lab 3: Type Casting and Conversion**

**Objective:** Demonstrate **implicit** and **explicit** type casting.
**Problem:**
Write a program that converts:

* An `int` to `double` (implicit cast)
* A `double` to `int` (explicit cast)
  Then display both results.

📚 *Concepts Covered:* Type conversion, casting operators, data loss

---

### 🔹 **Lab 4: User Input and Simple Computation**

**Objective:** Handle user input using the `Scanner` class.
**Problem:**
Take two floating-point numbers as input and display their **sum**, **difference**, and **quotient**.

📚 *Concepts Covered:* Scanner class, floating-point arithmetic, formatted output

---

### 🔹 **Lab 5: One-Dimensional Array Basics**

**Objective:** Learn declaration, initialization, and traversal of arrays.
**Problem:**
Create an integer array of size `5`.
Take input from the user, then calculate and display the **sum** of all elements.

📚 *Concepts Covered:* Arrays, loops, summation

---

### 🔹 **Lab 6: Finding Maximum and Minimum in 1D Array**

**Objective:** Practice comparing and traversing array elements.
**Problem:**
Read 6 integers into an array and find the **maximum** and **minimum** values.

📚 *Concepts Covered:* Array traversal, comparison operators, conditional logic

---

### 🔹 **Lab 7: 2D Array Input and Display**

**Objective:** Work with 2D arrays (matrices).
**Problem:**
Create a 3×3 matrix of integers, take input from the user, and display it in matrix form.

📚 *Concepts Covered:* Nested loops, matrix representation, multidimensional arrays

---

### 🔹 **Lab 8: Matrix Addition**

**Objective:** Perform arithmetic operations on 2D arrays.
**Problem:**
Take two 2×2 matrices as input and print their **sum** matrix.

📚 *Concepts Covered:* 2D array operations, nested loops, addition logic

---

### 🔹 **Lab 9: Ragged (Jagged) Array Example**

**Objective:** Understand jagged (non-rectangular) arrays in Java.
**Problem:**
Create a 2D jagged array with:

* 1st row → 2 elements
* 2nd row → 3 elements
* 3rd row → 4 elements
  Fill it with consecutive integers starting from `1` and display it.

📚 *Concepts Covered:* Jagged arrays, dynamic row sizes, nested loops

---

### 🔹 **Lab 10: 2D Array – Row-wise Sum**

**Objective:** Strengthen nested loop usage with 2D arrays.
**Problem:**
Create a 3×4 integer array and compute the **sum of each row**.

📚 *Concepts Covered:* 2D array traversal, cumulative sum, nested iteration
